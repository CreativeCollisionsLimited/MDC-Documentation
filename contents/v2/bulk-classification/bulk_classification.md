# Bulk Classification



## What's the Bulk Classification?

Bulk implies an aggregate that is impressively large, heavy, or numerous.

The bulk upload using a spreadsheet  allows the user to collect information from  multiple locations in one place, and upload the data to verify multiple business locations at once.

In this case, users must upload a file - find the template on the helpful information page, with the product description, country of origin, and country of destination.

Once the upload is made, the system will process the file and return the HS Code for each product on the list.
