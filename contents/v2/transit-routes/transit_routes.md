# Transit Routes

## What's Transite Route?

Carriers have different agreements depending on the country of destination goods are being shipped to. Sometimes parcels don’t go directly to their final destination and they have to transit through an intermediary country. In the system, this intermediary destination is called transit country.
The admin can create predefined routes enabling users to select the country of origin and destination where it’s possible to track the parcel’s itinerary and calculate eventual taxes and duties.
