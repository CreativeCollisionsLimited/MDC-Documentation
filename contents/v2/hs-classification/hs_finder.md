# Hs Classification
##### A feature to help you find an appropriate Harmonized System Code based on a description.

## What is a Hs Code?

Harmonized System (HS) Codes are commonly used throughout the export process for goods. The Harmonized System is a standardized numerical method of classifying traded products. It is used by customs authorities around the world to identify products when assessing duties and taxes and for gathering statistics.

The HS code can be described as follows:

- It is a six-digit identification code.
- It has 5000 commodity groups.
- Those groups have 99 chapters.
- Those chapters have 21 sections.
- Itâ€™s arranged in a legal and logical structure.
- Well-defined rules support it to realize uniform classification worldwide.

The Hs code is divided into sections, chapters, headings, and subheadings.

For example, "1006209400". 
- The first two digits corresponds to the section and chapter. In this case, the section is Vegetable Products (section 1), and the Chapter is Cereals (10).
- The next two digits corresponds to the headings. In this case, "06" that is Rice. The next two digits corresponds to the subheading, which "20" is "Husked (brown) rice".
- The last four digits are no more subdivided and give the final information to identify more specifically his kind and tariff. In here, "9400" classify it as "Medium grain".
