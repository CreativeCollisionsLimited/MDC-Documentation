# Personal Information


## What's Personal Information?

This feature refers to information that can be used to identify, locate, or contact an individual, alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information.

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (referred to as a data subject). An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier like a name, identification number, or location data, or to one or more factors specific to a person's physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity ((EU) 2016/679, Art. 4(1)).
