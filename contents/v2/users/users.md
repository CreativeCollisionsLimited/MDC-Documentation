## What's User Management?

User management enables admins to control user access and on-board and off-board users to and from the system’s resources. Subsequently, a directory service will then authenticate, authorise, and audit user access to the system’s resources based on what the company’s admin had dictated.

This feature solves the problem of managing user access to various resources. For example, the admin team generally requires access to different features in the system compared to the finance team. Further, a normal consumer likely doesn’t need access to internal financial systems and vice versa.

## Admin portal
- A list with the users registered in the system is available on the menu "Users", on `Admin home > Users`
Only admin can add or edit the user on this list.
