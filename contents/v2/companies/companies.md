## What's Companies Management?

Company management allows admins to create and control companies inside the system. In case a company has branches, admin users can register new companies. If this option is necessary, the admin user’s company becomes a “Parent Company” and it enables users to access admin and finance information of all its branches.

In order to get a company registered, fields such as name, address, and email are required. It’s also possible to enable the Landed Cost Calculation and/or HS Classification APIs.
