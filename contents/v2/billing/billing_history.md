# Billing History


## What's the Billing Page?

This is a feature for the administrators and finance teams. Itâ€™s possible to track all the transactions made in the system and how much they cost.

Each API request on the system generates a fee. The billing history displays the searches users have made in the system within a period of time. Besides the product information, each transaction shows who made it, when, and which APIs were called.


## Admin portal

 - Administrators and finance teams can find the billing history page on `Admin home > Billing History`
